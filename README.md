# Infinity
A collection of all the Discord bots for Infinity

In order to recreate these Discord bots, each folder needs a config.json file containing a bot token.<br>
Then while in the folder directories, use NPM to install Discord.js from the command prompt.<br>
`npm install discord.js`<br>

See https://www.npmjs.com/ for more info.

**Don't forget to change the ID's in the code according to your Discord server!**<br>
Now you should be able to start the bots using either a code runner on your IDE or PM2 from the command prompt.<br>
`pm2 start main.js`<br>

See https://pm2.keymetrics.io/ for more info.
